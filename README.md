# Property Manager
Property manager using Play and SCALA

Starter project : [SLICK EXAMPLE](https://github.com/playframework/play-slick/tree/master/samples/computer-database)


To run the project first do:
* sbt
* run
* go to [localhost](http://localhost:9000)
* click run script
* go to sbt console, press enter
* run (again)
* click run script one last time

>> While doing this project I discovered a bug with SLICK running in DEV mode. A JIRA task will be created later to tackle this issue.
